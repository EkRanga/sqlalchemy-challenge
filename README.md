# sqlalchemy-challenge
In this challenge, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
Precipitation Analysis
Find the most recent date in the dataset.
Using that date, get the previous 12 months of precipitation data by querying the previous 12 months of data.
Select only the "date" and "prcp" values.
Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame. Explicitly set the column names.
Sort the DataFrame values by "date".
Plot the results by using the DataFrame plot method, as the following image shows:
